The data is a subset of the smartphone data set found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data is collected of the accelerometers of a Samsung Galaxy S. In this project we have only taken the mean and the standards deviation for each measurement.
The variables in the data set is explained below. Many of the variables have a direction of either X, Y, or Z, here they are merged to one variable, abbreviated XYZ.

*  tBodyAcceleration-mean-XYZ 
 The mean acceleration of body in time domain, in direction X/Y/Z 

*  tBodyAcceleration-std-XYZ 
 The standard deviation of acceleration of body in time domain, in direction X/Y/Z 

*  tGravityAcceleration-mean-XYZ 
 The mean gravity acceleration in time domain, in direction X/Y/Z 

*  tGravityAcceleration-std-XYZ 
 The standard deviation of gravity acceleration in time domain, in direction X/Y/Z
